Machine Learning Final Project for MSDS 699: Wine Quality Model

My name is Dashiell Brookhart and I created this project for my Machine Learning Lab class as part of the University of San Francisco's Masters in Data Science program. 

This project is in regard to the research question: can we predict the quality of red/white wine based off its chemical composition? 

This project is important as the market for wine has increased exponentially throughout the past few decades. As demand for fine wine grows, the importance of being able to predict the quality of wine has increased as well. Thus, I thought it would be interesting to see if I could create a machine learning model that could accurately predict whether a wine was of high quality or low quality. For my project, I decided to define low quality wine as wine that had a quality rating below 7, while high quality wine was rated 7 and above. 

From my project, I found that my model was very accurate in predicting whether a wine was low quality, but my model had issues in correctly predicting a high quality wine as a high quality wine. There are still many uses for my model, as it has a great F1 score, but some changes need to be made to increase the precision and recall scores for predicting high quality wine.
